# Daily Wallpaper Generator
This script generates a daily wallpaper image composed of randomly placed colored circles.

Image generation is randomly seeded based on the BBC website.

An example output image looks like this:
<img src="images/current/generated_image.png" alt="Example Wallpaper" width="100"/>
